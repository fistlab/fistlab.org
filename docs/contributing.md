## [](#intro) Introduction

Contributions are **welcome** and will be fully **credited**.
We accept contributions via Pull Requests on Github.
  - [Fistlab on Github](https://github.com/fistlab)

All pull requests and issues should be added to that
organization and not any language specific organization
like [FistPHP](https://github.com/fistphp).

{#pr}
## [](#pr) Pull Requests

- **Add tests!** - Your patch won’t be accepted if it doesn’t have tests.

- **Document any change in behaviour** - Make sure the `readme.md` and any other relevant documentation are kept up-to-date.

- **Consider our release cycle** - We try to follow [SemVer v2.0.0](http://semver.org/). Randomly breaking public APIs is not an option.

- **Create feature branches** - Don't ask us to pull from your master branch.

- **One pull request per feature** - If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.

- **Send coherent history** - Make sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful. If you had to make multiple intermediate commits while developing.
