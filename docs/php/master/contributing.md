## [](#pr) Pull Requests

- **Add tests!** - Your patch won’t be accepted if it doesn’t have tests.

- **Document any change in behaviour** - Make sure the `readme.md` and any other relevant documentation are kept up-to-date.

- **Consider our release cycle** - We try to follow [SemVer v2.0.0](http://semver.org/). Randomly breaking public APIs is not an option.

- **Create feature branches** - Don't ask us to pull from your master branch.

- **One pull request per feature** - If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.

- **Send coherent history** - Make sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful. If you had to make multiple intermediate commits while developing.

## [](#style) Coding Style

Fistlab PHP components follows the [PSR-2](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md) coding standard and the [PSR-4](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-4-autoloader.md) autoloading standard.

#### StyleCI
Don't worry if your code styling isn't perfect! StyleCI will automatically merge any style fixes into the Fistlab PHP repository after pull requests are merged.
