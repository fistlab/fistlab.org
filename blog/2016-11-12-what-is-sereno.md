We all have our own stories, they may not be very adventurous, not very romantic, not very
mysterious, not much action but they always present **a unique self portrait**. Imagine your story is
available to billions on earth connected by the internet, a new type synergy
is evident. With a network so powerful which gives you power to influence whole
world at once, you can tell your story and be remembered as your true self.

## In Theory
**Sereno** is a static website generator, that can generate websites, portfolios, blogs or documentations.
There are dozens of content publishing applications on the internet but we know,
your story is unique, so should be your website/blog. Sereno wants to help you
to put your story out for people in your own style.

You can generate **your static website or blog** effortlessly using Sereno and publish
it yourself with Github Pages (for free). In the following articles, we would
demonstrate how to do all of it.

Till then.
